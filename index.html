  <h3>Frequently asked Questions:</h3>

  <p>
    Q. <i>I am a busy person and don't have much time. Will I be fine with only X hours per week of time?</i><br>
    <br>
    A. Lessons will be structured such that you may put in as much time as you want. 
    With just an hour a week you can learn by analyzing the examples and adding slight modifications. 
    If you have much more, you will be given opportunity and resources to go above and beyond.

  <p>
    Q. <i>Will this workshop still be helpful if my ultimate goal is not being a game developer?</i><br>
    <br>
    A. Yes! For two big reasons: 1. Games give you immediate visual feedback on what your code is doing. This clear feedback often keeps people engaged and enjoying programming. 2. Making games is hard! You will learn programming fundamentals and how to solve difficult problems.

    Q. <i>Why are you qualified to host this workshop?</i><br>
    <br>
    A. I have completed 4 game jams including GMTK 2020 where my game <a href="https://cegexe.itch.io/rotato-ship">Rotato Ship</a> placed as a finalist. I have recently graduated college with a BS in Comp Sci, and currently have a full time job doing software engineering. In my freetime, I do freelance work with Godot where I teach, create small projects, and help with larger projects.
